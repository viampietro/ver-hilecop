# HILECOP certification project (HilecopCert).

The HILECOP certification project (HilecopCert) aims at the
formal verification of HILECOP, a process for the design and
implementation of critical digital systems.

In HILECOP, high-level models build with Petri nets (PNs) represent
the architecture and the behavior of digital systems.
Then, through a model-to-text transformation, VHDL code is generated 
from the models, and finally the code is compiled and synthetized
into a logical circuit implemented on FPGA (Programmable Gate Array circuit).

HilecopCert purpose is to ensure that, through the model-to-text
transformation, the behavior of digital systems as described in 
PN-based models is preserved in VHDL code.

## Build the project.

### Pre-requisites.

You must install Coq v.8.9 (or >) before trying to build the project.
You also need `make`. 
All following commands must be executed in the directory containing 
this README file.

### Building procedure.

To generate all the .vo files, thereby checking the proof, just type `make`
under your local repository. Type `make clean` if you want to delete the files
generated by a previous build procedure.

## Project architecture.

- **sitpn** : Contains the SITPN token player program, the implementation of
              the SITPN semantics, along with the proofs of correctness (SitpnCorrect.v)
              and completeness (SitpnComplete.v) between the token player program
              and the semantics.
- **test**  : Contains *.ndr files (tina format for Petri nets), Coq implementation
              of Petri nets instances, and tests of the token player programs.
- **utils** : Contains helper tactics (HilecopTactics.v) and lemmas
	      (HilecopLemmas.v) used in HILECOP verification proofs.
