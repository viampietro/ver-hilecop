# HILECOP verification project (VerHilecop)

The HILECOP verification project (VerHilecop) aims at the
formal verification of HILECOP, a process for the design and
implementation of critical digital systems.

In HILECOP, high-level models build with Petri nets (PNs) represent
the architecture and the behavior of digital systems.
Then, through a model-to-text transformation, VHDL code is generated 
from the models, and finally the code is compiled and synthetized
into a logical circuit implemented on FPGA (Programmable Gate Array circuit).

VerHilecop purpose is to ensure that, through the model-to-text
transformation, the behavior of digital systems as described in 
PN-based models is preserved in VHDL code.

## Build the project

### Pre-requisites

You must install Coq v.8.9 (or >) before trying to build the project.
You also need `make`. 
All following commands must be executed in the directory containing 
this README file.

### Building procedure

To generate all the .vo files, thereby checking the proof, just type `make`
under your local repository. Type `make cleanall` if you want to delete the files
generated by a previous build procedure.

## Project architecture

- **sitpn** : Contains the SITPN token player program, the implementation of
              the SITPN semantics, along with the proofs of correctness (SitpnCorrect.v)
              and completeness (SitpnComplete.v) between the token player program
              and the semantics. Also, contains an implementation of the SITPN semantics using 
              dependent-types (sitpn/dp).
- **hvhdl** : Contains the definition of H-VHDL (i.e, a subset of VHDL) syntax and
  	      semantics. Also contains the definition of the Place and Transition
	      designs in abstract syntax, instances of which are generated by the
	      model-to-text transformation from an SITPN to H-VHDL code.
- **test**  : Contains *.ndr files (tina format for Petri nets), Coq implementation
              of Petri nets instances, and tests of the token player programs.
- **utils** : Contains structures, lemmas and tactics used
  	      in all parts of the project.
