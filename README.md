# HILECOP verification project (VerHilecop)

The HILECOP verification project (VerHilecop) aims at the formal
verification of HILECOP, a methodology for the design and
production/synthesis of safety-critical digital systems.

In HILECOP, high-level models based on a particular kind of Petri nets
(called SITPNs for Synchronously executed Interpreted Time Petri Nets)
represent the architecture and the behavior of digital systems. Then,
through a model-to-text transformation, VHDL code is generated from
the models, and finally the code is compiled and synthetized into a
logical circuit implemented on FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array
circuit) or an ASIC (Application-Specific Intergrated Circuit).

The project VerHilecop purpose is to ensure that, through the
model-to-text transformation, the behavior of digital systems
described with PN-based models is preserved in VHDL code. The goal of
the verification is to prove a behavior preservation theorem for the
HILECOP model-to-text transformation, and, to mechanize the proof with
the Coq proof assistant.

## Project architecture

- **sitpn** : Contains the SITPN token player program, the implementation of
              the SITPN semantics, along with the proofs of correctness (SitpnCorrect.v)
              and completeness (SitpnComplete.v) between the token player program
              and the semantics. Also, contains an implementation of the SITPN semantics using 
              dependent-types (sitpn/dp).
- **hvhdl** : Contains the definition of H-VHDL (i.e, a subset of VHDL) syntax and
  	      semantics. Also contains the definition of the Place and Transition
	      designs in abstract syntax, instances of which are generated by the
	      model-to-text transformation from an SITPN to H-VHDL code.
- **test**  : Contains *.ndr files (tina format for Petri nets), Coq implementation
              of Petri nets instances, and tests of the token player programs.
- **utils** : Contains structures, lemmas and tactics used
  	      in all parts of the project.

## Building the project

### Pre-requisites

You must install Coq v.8.9 (or >) before trying to build the project.
You also need `make`. 
All following commands must be executed in the directory containing 
this README file.

### Building procedure

- Type `make without-proof` if you want to compile only the files
  related to the specification of the SITPN and the H-VHDL semantics,
  and the files related to the SITPN-to-H-VHDL transformation.

- Type `make with-proof` if you want to compile all files, including
  the files related to the proof of the behavior preservation theorem
  (i.e. the files under the `proofs/` subfolders and the `soundness`
  folder).

- Type `make cleanall` if you want to delete the files generated by a
  previous build procedure.
