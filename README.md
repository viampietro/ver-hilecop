# HILECOP certification project (HilecopCert).

The HILECOP certification project (HilecopCert) aims at the
formal verification of HILECOP, a process for the design and
implementation of critical digital systems.

In HILECOP, high-level models build with Petri nets (PNs) represent
the architecture and the behavior of digital systems.
Then, through a model-to-text transformation, VHDL code is generated 
from the models, and finally the code is compiled and synthetized
into a logical circuit implemented on FPGA (Programmable Gate Array circuit).

HilecopCert purpose is to ensure that, through the model-to-text
transformation, the behavior of digital systems as described in 
PN-based models is preserved in VHDL code.

## Build the project.

### Pre-requisites.

You must install Coq v.8.9 (or >) before trying to build the project.
You also need `make`. 
All following commands must be executed in the directory containing 
this README file.

### Building procedure.

To build the project, you have to generate a MakeFile from the configuration
described in \_CoqProject file, using the following command:

```bash
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o MakeFile
```

Then, just type `make` to complete the building procedure, or `make cleanall` 
if you want to delete the files generated by a previous build procedure.

## Project architecture.

- **Spn**   : Contains SPN token player program, SPN semantics definition,
              along with the proofs of correctness (SpnCorrect.v) and
	      completeness (SpnComplete.v) between token player program
	     and SPN semantics.

- **Utils** : Contains helper tactics (HilecopTactics.v) and lemmas
	      (HilecopLemmas.v) used in HILECOP verification proofs.
